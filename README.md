# BeverageApp

This project was created using Flutter, Firebase and BLoC-Cubit. The project has been tried to be developed by keeping the MVVM design pattern and writing clean code as much as possible. The project has 2 phases; The first of these is the application that users can use, and the other is the application that only admins can use. In this application, simply pulling the products written in firebase and adding them to the cart is done, and the orders are sent to the admin panel. And finally, the application will be tried to be developed further in the future, both in terms of UI and products.
